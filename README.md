# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Workflow
The notebook follows these main steps:
1. **Read the Data** – Load and explore the dataset.
2. **Preprocessing** – Clean, transform, and prepare data for modeling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize and analyze data distributions, correlations, and fraud patterns.
4. **Train the Model** – Apply machine learning algorithms to classify fraudulent transactions.
5. **Test the Model** – Evaluate performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
